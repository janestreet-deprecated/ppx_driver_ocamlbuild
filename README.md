This repository contains the ocamlbuild plugin for `ppx_driver` that
is no longer maintained and no longer part of `ppx_driver`. It should
work with `ppxlib` as well with minimal modifications.

It is no longer released in opam, but you should feel free to include
this code in your project, modify it as needed and redistribute it
under the terms of the MIT license.
